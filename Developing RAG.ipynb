Studies in controlled settings (efficacy) demonstrate that double-fortified salt (DFS; iron added to iodized salt) reduces the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency anemia.

What iron formulations are available and how do they affect iodized salt? Ferrous sulfate and encapsulated ferrous fumarate (both with various enhancers and/or coating materials) are the main iron formulations currently in use for DFS. Adding iron to iodized salt may lead to adverse changes in the product, specifically discoloration and losses in iodine content. These changes are greatest when the iodized salt used in DFS production is of low quality (e.g., contain impurities, has high moisture, and is of large crystal size).

DFS producers must use high-quality refined iodized salt meeting the minimum standards for DFS production (which is higher than standards for salt intended for iodization alone), and an iron formulation for which there are rigid quality-assurance measures to ensure consistent quality and blending techniques. The actual proportion of iodized salt meeting the stringent requirements necessary for DFS production is unclear, but likely to be low in many countries, especially those with fragmented salt industries and a low proportion of industrially produced salt.

The exact impact of this production-level cost difference on profit margins and consumer price is specific to the conditions of different salt markets. Factors such as transport costs, customary wholesale and retail mark-ups, and taxes all vary greatly and need to be assessed on a case by case basis. Is DFS in alignment with salt-reduction efforts? The WHO has long recognized that salt iodization is an important public health intervention to achieve optimal iodine nutrition and is compatible with salt-reduction goals.

In social safety net programs where the cost of DFS is subsidized for beneficiaries, programs must consider long-term resourcing for sustainability. Overall: The optimal production and delivery of DFS are still under development, as many challenges need to be overcome. There is a beneficial impact on hemoglobin in efficacy trials.

The importance of this temporal control is demonstrated by the strong associations between circadian disruption, morbidity and disease pathology. There is now a wealth of evidence linking the circadian timing system to metabolic physiology and nutrition. Relationships between these processes are often reciprocal, such that the circadian system drives temporal changes in metabolic pathways and changes in metabolic/nutritional status alter core molecular components of circadian rhythms. Examples of metabolic rhythms include daily changes in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and postprandial response. Time of day alters lipid and glucose profiles following individual meals whereas, over a longer time scale, meal timing regulates adiposity and body weight; these changes may occur via the ability of timed feeding to synchronise'\n",

Further, the biological activities examined in colon adenocarcinoma cells did not alter in a stepwise manner that could reflect the gradual changes in composition of bioactive ingredients. In conclusion, the experiments presented here showed that the growing complexity of a mixture of phytochemicals seems to create a new redox bioactive substance rather than enrich the mixture with new activities, characteristic of the compound added. It follows that no simple, predictable relationship can be expected between the chemopreventive potential and the composition of real food items containing a complicated set of non-toxic redox active ingredients. Our observations suggest that the interactions between different bioactive compounds and food matrix components are cooperating factors determining the final bioactivity of foods.'\n",

A systematic review of observational and intervention studies published between 2000 and January 2020 was conducted to assess nutrient intake and status in adult populations consuming plant-based diets (mainly vegetarian and vegan) with that of meat-eaters. Mean intake of nutrients were calculated and benchmarked to dietary reference values. For micronutrient status, mean concentrations of biomarkers were calculated and compared across diet groups. A total of 141 studies were included, mostly from Europe, South/East Asia, and North America.
